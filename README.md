# Contact Screen from Nested Json Data 

This is my Flutter exercise that aims to improve on previous versions of code to make the code easier to understand and easier to maintain.

## About

The goal is displaying Nested Json Data API from mock up data by [https://reqres.in/api/users?per_page=12](https://reqres.in/api/users?per_page=12) to ListView.builder.
